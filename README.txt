## 💾 GitHub Workflow – Working on Shared Sections

**Important:** Do **not commit or merge directly to `main`** until all sections are complete.

- Everyone works on **their own branch** for their assigned tasks or articles.  
  - Example branch names: `article-1`, `article-2`, `nav`, `hero-section`.  
- Make changes **only in your branch** and commit often.  
- Push your branch to GitHub regularly so your work is backed up.  
- Before starting new work, **pull updates from other branches** if needed to avoid conflicts.  
- If multiple people are working on the same section (e.g., articles), coordinate to ensure **each person works on different articles or tasks**.  
- Optionally, create a **shared branch for the section** (like `articles`) and submit **Pull Requests** into it instead of main.  
- Only **merge into `main` once the section or the entire project is finished**, keeping main stable.  
- Communicate with teammates when starting or finishing tasks to avoid overlapping edits.
